# Conclusion

Today, botting remains an ongoing issue in the gaming community. While some players use bots to automate mundane 
tasks or to enhance their gaming experience, others exploit them to gain unfair advantages, disrupting in-game 
economies and player experiences. Game developers continue to fight against botting with ever more sophisticated 
detection and prevention methods. 

In summary, botting in gaming has evolved from simple scripts in text-based 
games to complex automated systems in modern MMORPGs, reflecting broader trends in technology and player 
behavior. As games continue to evolve and technology advances, the battle between game developers and bot 
developers shows no signs of slowing down.
