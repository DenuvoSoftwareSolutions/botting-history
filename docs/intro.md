# Introduction

Automation has become a crucial aspect of modern life in the digital age, improving productivity, 
simplifying procedures, and changing entire sectors. The usage of "bots" — automated programs 
created to carry out tasks without human intervention — is one noteworthy feature of automation. 

Bots  and  automation  in  general  have  a  rich  and  diverse  history  and  can  be  used  as  a  helpful 
tool  for  routine  in-game  tasks  to  help  new  players  or,  in  more  contentious  situations,  carry  out 
harmful acts or obtain unfair advantages in competitive settings. 

Over  time,  the  internet's  expansion,  changing  user  needs,  and  technological  advancements 
have all had a significant impact on the concept of botting. Bot technology has evolved to match 
wider  developments  in  computing  and  digital  communication,  from  the  initial  days  of  simple 
scripts  and  rudimentary  automation  in  the  1990s  to  more  complex  artificial  intelligence  and 
machine learning-driven game bots of today. Knowing the background of botting offers important 
insights  into  the  ways  in  which  these  instruments  have  affected  many  sectors;  in  this  write-up, 
gaming will be the primary industry discussed. 

This  write-up  attempts  to  investigate  the  past  evolution  of  botting,  looking  at  its  inception, 
technological  advancements,  the  types  of  bots  which  are  found  in  marketplaces,  effects  on 
games,  reasons  for  bot  development,  utilization  of  bots,  and  the  steps  taken  to  control  their 
usage through anti-botting.
