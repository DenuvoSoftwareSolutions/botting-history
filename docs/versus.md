# Cheats versus bots

Bots are programs or scripts that are used to control a game by delivering commands (such as moving or clicking) 
in response to predefined patterns or conditions. These are frequently configured to behave in a manner similar 
to that of a human player, but without actual human involvement. 

Cheats alter or take advantage of the game's 
mechanics to provide a player with benefits that are not achievable through regular gameplay. Cheats can be used 
to change in-game variables (such health, speed, or resources) or get around restrictions by altering game 
files, inserting code, or using third-party applications.

| Aspect | Bot | Cheat |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose | Automates gameplay tasks, mimics human behavior. | Alters or exploits game mechanics to gain unfair advantage. |
| Function | Plays the game on behalf of the player. | Modifies the game directly. |
| Method | Uses scripts to simulate human input or control actions. | Changes game data, memory, or exploits vulnerabilities. |
| Common Uses | Farming, grinding, repetitive tasks, auto-aiming. | Seeing through walls, unlimited resources, flying and invincibility. |
| Impact | Automates tasks but can give unfair resource or time advantage. | Alters core mechanics, creating imbalances in gameplay. |
